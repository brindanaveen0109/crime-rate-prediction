# crime-rate-prediction
## Project Overview
This project uses a Linear Regression model to predict crime rates based on historical crime data. The goal is to analyze past crime trends and forecast future crime counts.
## Key Features
Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.
Training a Linear Regression model to predict crime rates.
Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
Visualizing actual vs. predicted crime count
## How It Works
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded and cleaned.
Model Training: A Linear Regression model is trained on the data.
Prediction: The model makes predictions on the test data.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated, and results are visualized.
## Future Improvements
Experiment with other machine learning models.
Add more features to improve prediction accuracy.
